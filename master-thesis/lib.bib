abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 IEEE.This paper studies the problem of resource allocation in overlay systems. A multiple-input single-output (MISO) primary link shares the spectrum with a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) secondary link, which in return acts as an amplify-And-forward (AF) relay, forwarding the primary message. The considered problem is the maximization of the secondary energy efficiency (EE) subject to a primary rate requirement. The resulting optimization problem is a fractional program which can not be tackled by traditional fractional optimization methods. Two algorithms are proposed, based on an interplay between fractional programming and sequential optimization theory, which trade-off performance and complexity. Numerical results demonstrate the merits of the proposed algorithms both in terms of energy-efficient performance and complexity.},

abstract = {Feature interactions (FIs, in short) occur when features of different communication services interfere with each other. The FI filtering is a pre-processing before the FI detection, which roughly identifies FI-prone service combinations based on simple indications of the FIs. We have previously proposed an FI filtering method at requirements stage using Use Case Maps (UCMs). This method identifies FI-prone service combinations by focusing on changes in user's scenarios before/after the service composition, but does not tell which scenarios in the compound services have a potential of FIs.In this paper, as an extension of the previous method, we propose a new method to derive FI-prone scenarios from the FI-prone combinations obtained by the previous method. From many practical FIs, we first make the following two observations: (a) FI tends to occur in scenarios where both services are activated, and (b) FI tends to occur in scenarios where a service bypasses a feature of the other service. Then, based on the observations, we propose heuristics on the UCM scenario paths to derive FI-prone scenarios. An experimental evaluation demonstrates that the derived scenarios successfully cover all scenarios that lead to actual FIs.},

A rich literature exists on the principle itself, discrete-time version and implementation, equalization, extension to MIMO, etc. This text, written in a tutorial style, explains the idea of Offset QAM and why it works from a Communications Engineer point of view. The language is very simple and the math elementary. Students and researchers in universities or practitioners who are interested in gaining an intuition into the logic behind OFDM-OQAM will hopefully enjoy reading this text. On the other hand, those interested in a quick understanding of the idea, just enough to start using the waveform, can find far better material.},

This method extends prior work on the joint optimization of physical layer representation and encoding and decoding processes as a single end-to-end task by expanding transmitter and receivers to the multi-antenna case. We introduce a widely used domain appropriate wireless channel impairment model (Rayleigh fading channel), into the autoencoder optimization problem in order to directly learn a system which optimizes for it. We considered both spatial diversity and spatial multiplexing techniques in our implementation. Our deep learning-based approach demonstrates significant potential for learning schemes which approach and exceed the performance of the methods which are widely used in existing wireless MIMO systems. We discuss how the proposed scheme can be easily adapted for open-loop and closed-loop operation in spatial diversity and multiplexing modes and extended use with only compact binary channel state information (CSI) as feedback.},

New technologies that use spectrum more efficiently and more cooperatively, unleashed by regulatory reforms, may soon overcome the spectrum shortage. To understand the impact new radio technologies are having on spectrum availability, it is helpful first to address a common misconception: that spectrum is a concrete and finite resource. Not so. Radio waves do not pass through some ethereal medium called "spectrum"; they are the medium. What is licensed by the governments is not a piece of a finite pie, but simply the right to deploy transmitters and receivers that operate in particular ways.},

The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.},

abstract = {A spectrum sharing scheme is proposed for overlaid wireless networks based on the decode-and-forward two-path successive relaying technique. In this scheme, two secondary transmitters are used to transmit secondary information alternately to their respective receivers while relaying the primary signal at the same time. The transmission of the primary system is continuous, and the secondary system can opportunistically help the primary transmission in exchange for the spectrum sharing. Superposition coding is used at the secondary transmitters, where the primary signal and secondary signal are linearly combined. Successive interference decoding and cancelation is performed by secondary users to extract their desired signals. For the primary system, joint decoding is performed by treating the secondary signal as noise at the receiver side. The optimal power allocation is determined to maximize the success probability of the secondary system without violating the outage performance of the primary system. Numerical and simulation results show that the proposed scheme can conservatively protect the primary performance while realizing the secondary transmission requirement.},

abstract = {This dissertation addresses the intersection of personal wireless technology and computational intelligence. The primary research issue addressed is the organization of radio domain knowledge into data structures processable in real-time that integrate machine learning and natural language processing technology into software radio. The thesis defines and develops the cognitive radio architecture. The features needed in the architecture are derived from cognitive radio use cases. These include inferring user communications context, shaping accessnetwork demand, and realizing a protocol for real-time radio spectrum rental. Mathematical foundations for the knowledge-representation architecture are derived by applying point-set topology to the requirements of the use cases. This results in the set-theoretic ontology of radio knowledge defined in the Radio Knowledge Representation Language (RKRL). The mathematical analysis also demonstrates that isochronous radio software is not Turingcomputable. Instead, it is constrained to a bounded-recursive subset of the total functions. A rapid-prototype cognitive radio, CR1, was developed to apply these mathematical foundations in a simulated environment. CR1 demonstrated the principles of cognitive radio and focused the research issues. This led to an important contribution of this dissertation, the cognitive radio architecture. This is an open architecture framework for integrating agent-based control, natural language processing, and machine learning technology into software-defined radio platforms.},

The . Abstract—Cognitive radios hold tremendous promise for in - creasing spectral efficiency in wireless systems . This paper sur - veys the fundamental capacity limits and associated transmission techniques for different wireless network design paradigms based on this promising technology . These paradigms are unified by the definition of a cognitive radio as an intelligent wireless communication device that exploits side information about its environment to improve spectrum utilization . This side informa - tion typically comprises knowledge about the activity , channels , codebooks and / or messages of other nodes with which the cognitive node shares the spectrum . Based on the nature of the available side information as well as a priori rules about spectrum usage , cognitive radio systems seek to underlay , overlay or interweave the cognitive radios ' signals with the transmissions of noncognitive nodes . We provide a comprehensive summary of the known capacity characterizations in terms of upper and lower bounds for each of these three approaches . The increase in system degrees of freedom obtained through cognitive radios is also illuminated . This information theoretic survey provides guidelines for the spectral efficiency gains possible through cognitive radios , as well as practical design ideas to mitigate the coexistence challenges in today ' s crowded spectrum .},

abstract = {We explore unsupervised representation learning of radio communication signals in raw sampled time series representation. We demonstrate that we can learn modulation basis functions using convolutional autoencoders and visually recognize their relationship to the analytic bases used in digital communications. We also propose and evaluate quantitative met- rics for quality of encoding using domain relevant performance metrics.},
